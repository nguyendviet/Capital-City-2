# Capital City 2

## Overview
A mobile friendly version of the previous game Guess The Capital City. 

### Why I built this app?
If you travel, you might spend a lot of time waiting in an airport, a train or bus station. I built this game so people can learn a bit more about geography during their trips to explore the world!

### Demo
* Github IO: [Capital City 2](https://nguyendviet.github.io/Capital-City-2/)

### Logic
* A name of an official capital city will be randomly generated.
* User guesses all the letters.
* The app will eventually show the location of the city on Google Map.

## Technologies
* jQuery
* Bootstrap 4
